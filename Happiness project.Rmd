<h2>

What is happiness

</h2>

<p>

Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy,
satisfaction, contentment, and fulfillment. While happiness has many
different definitions, it is often described as involving positive
emotions and life satisfaction.<br /><br /> When most people talk about
happiness, they might be talking about how they feel in the present
moment, or they might be referring to a more general sense of how they
feel about life overall.<br /> Because happiness tends to be such a
broadly defined term, psychologists and other social scientists
typically use the term 'subjective well-being' when they talk about this
emotional state. Just as it sounds, subjective well-being tends to focus
on an individual's overall personal feelings about their life in the
present.

The aim of this project

</h2>

<p>

The aim of this project is to observe the data from the World Happiness
Report for several years and to exploratory data analysis to search for
the difference in happiness levels between countries and try to
postulate some hypothesis

<h3>

Context

</h3>

<p>

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global
happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013,
the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World
Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was
released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day
of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global
recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly
use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.
Leading experts across fields -- economics, psychology, survey analysis,
national statistics, health, public policy and more -- describe how
measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the
progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the
world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal
and national variations in happiness.

Content

</h3>

<p>

The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll.
The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question
asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks
respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them
being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own
current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally
representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup
weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the
happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors --
economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence
of corruption, and generosity -- contribute to making life evaluations
higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country
that has values equal to the world's lowest national averages for each
of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for
each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than
others.

<h3>

Inspiration

</h3>

<p>

What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each
of the six factors contributing to happiness? How did country ranks or
scores change between the 2015 and 2016 as well as the 2016 and 2017
reports? Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease
in happiness?

**What is Dystopia?**

Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world's least-happy
people. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark
against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country
performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key
variables, thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive width. The
lowest scores observed for the six key variables, therefore,
characterize Dystopia. Since life would be very unpleasant in a country
with the world's lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest
generosity, most corruption, least freedom and least social support, it
is referred to as "Dystopia," in contrast to Utopia.

**What are the residuals?**

The residuals, or unexplained components, differ for each country,
reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or
under-explain average 2014-2016 life evaluations. These residuals have
an average value of approximately zero over the whole set of countries.
Figure 2.2 shows the average residual for each country when the equation
in Table 2.1 is applied to average 2014- 2016 data for the six variables
in that country. We combine these residuals with the estimate for life
evaluations in Dystopia so that the combined bar will always have
positive values. As can be seen in Figure 2.2, although some life
evaluation residuals are quite large, occasionally exceeding one point
on the scale from 0 to 10, they are always much smaller than the
calculated value in Dystopia, where the average life is rated at 1.85 on
the 0 to 10 scale.

**What do the columns succeeding the Happiness Score(like Family,
Generosity, etc.) describe?**

The following columns: GDP per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom,
Generosity, Trust Government Corruption describe the extent to which
these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness in each country.
The Dystopia Residual metric actually is the Dystopia Happiness
Score(1.85) + the Residual value or the unexplained value for each
country as stated in the previous answer.

If you add all these factors up, you get the happiness score so it might
be un-reliable to model them to predict Happiness Scores.

<h3>Displaying the data</h3>
```{r caption="Data frame is now printed using `kable`.",render=lemon_print}
head(d2015)
head(d2016)
head(d2017)
head(d2018)
head(d2019)
```

<br/><br/> <b>First 5 countries</b><br/><br/> First let's see the top 5
for the years 2015, 2016. 2017, 2018, and 2019.

```{r}
d2015[,c("Country", "Happiness.Rank", "Happiness.Score")] |> head(5)
d2016[,c("Country", "Happiness.Rank", "Happiness.Score")] |> head(5)
d2017[,c("Country", "Happiness.Rank", "Happiness.Score")] |> head(5)
d2018[,c("Country.or.region", "Overall.rank", "Score")] |> head(5)
d2019[,c("Country.or.region", "Overall.rank", "Score")] |> head(5)
```

We can clearly see that the nordic countries like Finland, Norway and
Denkmare are constantly at the top. <br/><br/> <b>Last 5
countries</b><br/><br/> Now let's see at the 5 countries that score the
least.

```{r}
d2015[,c("Country", "Happiness.Rank", "Happiness.Score")] |> tail(5)
d2016[,c("Country", "Happiness.Rank", "Happiness.Score")] |> tail(5)
d2017[,c("Country", "Happiness.Rank", "Happiness.Score")] |> tail(5)
d2018[,c("Country.or.region", "Overall.rank", "Score")] |> tail(5)

<h3>

Intresting correlations

</h3>

<br/>

<h4>

Overall

</h4>

Let's see overall some correlations between some columns of the dataset
and the score.

```{r}
fit <- lm(Score ~ GDP.per.capita + Social.support + Healthy.life.expectancy + Freedom.to.make.life.choices + Generosity + Perceptions.of.corruption, data=d2019)
avPlots(fit, ask=FALSE)
```

Now let's go into the specifics of some intresing correlation

<h4>

GDP and happiness score

</h4>

<p>

It's intresting to see some correlations between the data in order to
understand how there could be massive differences between the first and
the last five countries . For example, the following is the correlation
between the life expectancy and the happiness score, displaying also the
life expectancy. We can see that the correlation is quite stable across
time.

</p>

```{r}
ggplot(d2015) + geom_point(aes(x=Happiness.Score, y=Economy..GDP.per.Capita. , col=Health..Life.Expectancy.))
ggplot(d2016) + geom_point(aes(x=Happiness.Score, y=Economy..GDP.per.Capita. , col=Health..Life.Expectancy.))
ggplot(d2017) + geom_point(aes(x=Happiness.Score, y=Economy..GDP.per.Capita. , col=Health..Life.Expectancy.))
ggplot(d2018) + geom_point(aes(x=Score, y=GDP.per.capita , col=Healthy.life.expectancy))
ggplot(d2019) + geom_point(aes(x=Score, y=GDP.per.capita , col=Healthy.life.expectancy))
```

<br/>

<h4>

Generosity and GDP

</h4>

It's intrenting to see if when people are richer they care less about
the generosity of others. In order to answer this question it's
sufficient to display the correlation between Generosity and GDP.

```{r}
g <- ggplot(d2019, aes(Generosity, GDP.per.capita))
g + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F) 
```

It seems that people are more sensitive to generosity when they have
less resources, which makes sense.

<h4>

Perception of corruption and score

</h4>

Now let's see how much the perception of corruption influences the
happiness score

```{r}
g <- ggplot(d2019, aes(Perceptions.of.corruption, Score))
g + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F) 
```

<h4>

Freedom to make life choices and score

</h4>

Now let's see how much the perception of corruption influences the
happiness score

```{r}
g <- ggplot(d2019, aes(Freedom.to.make.life.choices, Score))
g + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F) 
```

<p>

It doesn't surprise that the more freedom to make life choices, the more
people are happy.
</p>

<h3>Grouping by Region</h3>

<h4>Happiness Score by Region</h4>
<p>Now let's see the average happiness score by Region (year 2015)</p>
```{r}
r <- d2015 %>%
  select(Region, Happiness.Score) %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            happinessMean = mean(Happiness.Score),
            happinessMedian = median(Happiness.Score),
            happinessStandard = sd(Happiness.Score))

ggplot(r, aes(x = fct_reorder(Region, happinessMedian), y = happinessMean, fill = happinessMean)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "Identity", show.legend = F) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "red", high = "green") +
  labs(y="", x="",fill = "Score",
       title = "Average Happiness score grouped by Region") +
  theme_light(base_size = 9) + coord_flip()

```
<p>The result shows that the region where people feel more happy is "Australia and New Zealand"</p>

<h4>GDP by Region</h4>
<p>Now let's see the average GDP per capita score by Region (year 2015)</p>
```{r}
r <- d2015 %>%
  select(Region, Economy..GDP.per.Capita.) %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            gdpMean = mean(Economy..GDP.per.Capita.),
            gdpMedian = median(Economy..GDP.per.Capita.),
            happinessStandard = sd(Economy..GDP.per.Capita.))

ggplot(r, aes(x = fct_reorder(Region, gdpMedian), y = gdpMean, fill = gdpMean)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "Identity", show.legend = F) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "blue") +
  labs(y="", x="",fill = "Economy..GDP.per.Capita.",
       title = "Average GDP score grouped by Region") +
  theme_light(base_size = 9) + coord_flip()
```
<p>Despite Australia and New Zealand is at the top for happiness score it is not for the GDP score per capita. As we can see, the first for GDP is North America, followed by Western Europe.</p>

<h3>Distribution of density</h3>
<p>Let's have a look at the distribution of density of the happiness score</p>
```{r}
ggplot(d2019,aes(Score))+
  geom_density()
median(d2019$Score)
mean(d2019$Score)
sd(d2019$Score)
```
<p>As most complex phenomena, the distribution is a Gaussian curve. The unusual thing is that it is quite flat at the mean. Furthermore we can see that both the mean and the median are above the theoretical mean (that would be (10-0)/2=5). This is an optimistic data. </p>
<h3Improvements across time></h3>
<p>Now let's see if between 2015 an 2019 the mean and the median have shifted</p>
```{r}
mean(d2015$Happiness.Score)
mean(d2016$Happiness.Score)
mean(d2017$Happiness.Score)
mean(d2018$Score)
mean(d2019$Score)
mean(d2019$Score)-mean(d2015$Happiness.Score)
```
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<h4>When will we all reach 10</h4>
<p>While the technical answer is never, we can see that from 2015 and and 2019 there is been an overall improvement of 0.03136198 in the level of happiness of people. This theoretically and utopically would mean that, assuming a costant rate of improvement in (10-mean(d2019$Score))/(mean(d2019$Score)-mean(d2015$Happiness.Score))*(2019-2015)=585 years years the mean would reach 10.0</p>

<h4>How to reach that</h4>
<p>We saw the clear correlation between happiness and the GDP per capita. One likely way to improve the happiness of most people would be to improve the average level of wealth. Of course, while doing so, there are other things to improve such as removing the corruption and enhancing freedom.</p>
```{r}
(10-mean(d2019$Score))/(mean(d2019$Score)-mean(d2015$Happiness.Score))*(2019-2015)
```
